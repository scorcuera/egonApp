## Introduction

Welcome to Egon, an innovative application designed to foster a culture of recognition and motivation within teams. Egon is inspired by the principles of peer recognition platforms like Nailted and is tailored to enhance workplace morale by allowing team members to commend each other.

### Key Features of Egon:

ðŸ”¹ Peer-to-Peer Recognition: Egon enables team members to give verbal awards to each other, encapsulating these commendations in the form of "claps". This simple yet powerful mechanism allows colleagues to express appreciation for each other's efforts and achievements.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Weekly Notifications</strong>: Every Monday, team members receive notifications showcasing the claps they have received from their peers. This regular acknowledgment serves as a weekly morale booster and starts the week on a positive note.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Clap Budget</strong>: To add value to each clap and prevent inflation of recognition, each team member is allocated a limited number of claps to distribute each week. This limitation ensures that claps are given thoughtfully and that they retain their significance as a form of recognition.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Accumulative Recharge</strong>: Each week, team members' clap balances are replenished with an additional 100 claps. Unused claps from the previous week will carry over, rewarding those who are selective with their recognition.

Egon is more than just a tool; it's a way to make recognition a valuable and sought-after asset within your team. By integrating Egon into your team's routine, you can help build a supportive environment that celebrates each member's contributions and fosters a strong sense of community. Get ready to clap and be clapped, and watch as motivation and workplace happiness soar!
