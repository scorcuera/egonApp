#### <ins>Key Features of Egon</ins>:

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Peer-to-Peer Recognition</strong>: Egon enables team members to give verbal awards to each other, encapsulating these commendations in the form of "claps". This allows colleagues to express appreciation for each other's efforts and achievements.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Weekly Notifications</strong>: Every Monday, team members receive notifications showcasing the claps they have received from their peers. This regular acknowledgment serves as a weekly morale booster and starts the week on a positive note.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Clap Budget</strong>: To ensures that claps are given thoughtfully and that they retain their significance as a form of recognition, each team member is allocated a limited number of claps to distribute each week.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Accumulative Recharge</strong>: Each week, team members' clap balances are replenished with an additional 100 claps. Unused claps from the previous week will carry over.
