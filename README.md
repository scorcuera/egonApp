## Introduction

Welcome to Egon, an innovative application designed to foster a culture of recognition and motivation within teams. Egon is inspired by the principles of peer recognition platforms like Nailted and is tailored to enhance workplace morale by allowing team members to commend each other.

By integrating Egon into your team's routine, you can help build a supportive environment that celebrates each member's contributions and fosters a strong sense of community. Get ready to clap and be clapped, and watch as motivation and workplace happiness soar!


#### <ins>Key Features of Egon</ins>:

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Peer-to-Peer Recognition</strong>: Egon enables team members to give verbal awards to each other, encapsulating these commendations in the form of "claps". This allows colleagues to express appreciation for each other's efforts and achievements.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Weekly Notifications</strong>: Every Monday, team members receive notifications showcasing the claps they have received from their peers. This regular acknowledgment serves as a weekly morale booster and starts the week on a positive note.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Clap Budget</strong>: To ensures that claps are given thoughtfully and that they retain their significance as a form of recognition, each team member is allocated a limited number of claps to distribute each week.

ðŸ”¹ <strong>Accumulative Recharge</strong>: Each week, team members' clap balances are replenished with an additional 100 claps. Unused claps from the previous week will carry over.

## ðŸš€ Getting started

### Client

To run the client, follow these steps:

Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed:

```shell
npm i
```

Run the command `npm run dev` to start the client.

The client should now be running and accessible at the specified port.

### Server

First, install the dependencies:

```shell
npm i
```

Then, update the environment variables. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project if it doesn't already exist. 

```YAML
# Node.js server port
PORT=3000

# Database connection string (replace placeholders with actual values)
DATABASE_URL="mysql://[DB_USERNAME]:[DB_PASSWORD]@localhost:3306/[DB_DATABASE]"

# JWT secret for authentication
JWT_SECRET='yourSecret'
```

Replace `[DB_USERNAME]`, `[DB_PASSWORD]`, and `[DB_DATABASE]` with your MySQL database username, password, and database name respectively.

Run Prisma migrations to update your database schema with the latest changes:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Once the migrations are successfully applied, you can start your server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```
